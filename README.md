To view a development version of the application, you can view here: http://prayerwall-grace-church.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prayerwall. Feel free to add a request or reply to see functionality.

This was designed to use the same styles as the main website. There is only one page available at this time (prayer wall)

The dev version of the app is being hosted in S3. Other AWS resources used are API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB. This repo just contains the react portion of the app.
